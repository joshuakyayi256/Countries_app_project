# Rest Countries API Integration Challenge

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for taking on this front-end coding challenge. The task involves integrating with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) to fetch country data and present it as per the provided designs.

**Prerequisites:**
To complete this challenge successfully, a good understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is required.

## The Challenge

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to build a front-end application with the following features:

- Display all countries from the REST Countries API on the homepage.
- Implement a search functionality allowing users to search for a country using an `input` field.
- Enable filtering of countries by region.
- Allow users to click on a country to view more detailed information on a separate page.
- Provide the ability to navigate to border countries from the detail page.
- Include an optional feature to toggle between light and dark mode color schemes.

## Where to Find Everything

### Designs
The project designs can be found in the `/design` folder. You will find mobile and desktop designs in both light and dark mode color schemes for both pages. Designs are in JPG static format, guiding you on styles such as `font-size`, `padding`, and `margin`.

### Style Guide
Refer to the `style-guide.md` file for essential information, including the color palette and fonts to be used.

## Building Your Project

Feel free to adopt any workflow you are comfortable with. However, here's a suggested process:

1. Initiate your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). This facilitates code sharing with the community if assistance is needed.
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address. This is useful for sharing your project during challenges.
3. Examine the designs to plan your project effectively, ensuring CSS classes are created for reusable styles.
4. Begin by structuring your content with HTML. This ensures well-organized content.
5. Develop the base styles for your project, covering general content styles like `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Progressively add styles from the top down, focusing on one section at a time.
